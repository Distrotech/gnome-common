This module is intended for people who want to develop
GNOME Applications outside of the GNOME CVS tree or for
people who're developing inside GNOME CVS, but don't want
to carry the macros/ directory in their module.

There are two modes of operation:

1.) The GNOME 1.x platform is what you get when you
    configure this module without any special parameters.

    This installs everything from the `macros' directory
    in `$(datadir)/aclocal/gnome-macros' and provides a
    `gnome-autogen.sh' in `$(bindir)'.

2.) To enable support for the GNOME 2.x platform, gnome-common's
    configure has a `--enable-platform-gnome-2' command line
    argument which you need to use.

    The difference is that the GNOME 2.x version will require
    a recent version of pkg-config (from freedesktop.org at
    <http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/>) and also
    compile the `support' directory.

    This is considered "hacker stuff" and has the same disclaimer
    than gnome-libs HEAD.


To use this module in your package, you need to:
    
1.) Compile and install gnome-common like any normal package.

2.) You don't need to have a `macros/' dir in your package,
    this stuff is going to replace it.

3.) In your autogen.sh use this:

    ---
    . gnome-autogen.sh
    ---

    instead of

    ---
    . macros/autogen.sh
    ---

4.) In you configure.in, remove the

    ---
    AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDE(macros)
    ---

    and replace it with

    ---
    GNOME_COMMON_INIT
    ---

That's it. Now your app uses the macros which are installed
from gnome-common.

[This is only intended for "hackers":

 If you want to use GNOME 2.0, just use

 ---
 USE_GNOME_2_MACROS=1 . gnome-autogen.sh
 ---

 in your autogen.sh.

 There's an example for this in LibGTop HEAD.
