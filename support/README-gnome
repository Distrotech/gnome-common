Note to Gnome hackers:

Some files in this directory are taken verbatim from glibc.
Do not modify them.  If you find a bug, report it as you would any
glibc bug.

When updating the glibc files in the master Gnome repository, be sure
to use "cvs import".  That will ensure that any local changes are
merged in.

Yes, there are some minor local changes.  Hopefully these will be
sorted out with the glibc maintainer before long.
