1998-06-11  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (gnomesupport.h): Build with `gnomesupport.awk'.
	(CROSS_COMPILING): Remove.
	* gnomesupport.awk: New file, to replace `gnomesupport-h.c'.
	* gnomesupport-h.c: Removed.  Doesn't work well in cross-compiles.

1998-06-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* Makefile.am (gnomesupport-h): When cross-compiling, this
	is build using `$(build_CC)' because it needs to run on the
	build system. Look at gnome-libs/configure.in to see how to
	get `build_CC'.

Thu May 21 21:21:12 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* gnome-argp.h: Unconditionally declare program_invocation_name
	and program_invocation_short_name; some systems define these but
	don't declare them.

1998-05-20  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Define _GNU_SOURCE.

1998-05-19  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gnomesupport-h.c (strerror): Emit declaration.
	* strerror.c: New file.  Imported from GNU libiberty.

1998-05-19  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* vsnprintf.c (vsnprintf): Changed declaration of this
	function on systems defining __STDC__ to avoid clash
	with prototype in system header file.

	* vsnprintf.c (snprintf): Moved toward the end of the
	file, so that the compiler sees correct declaration for
	vsnprintf().

1998-05-12  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@fib.hl.no>

	* argp-help.c (argp_doc): Backed out previous "fix". :-)
	As pointed out it was dead wrong.
	
1998-05-09  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@fib.hl.no>

	* argp-help.c (argp_doc): Removed a compiler warning.

1998-04-14  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gnomesupport-h.c (main): Make gnomesupport.h include stddef.h
	unconditionally. 

1998-04-13  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* scandir.c (<sys/types.h>): Include.
	* gnomesupport-h.c (!HAVE_SCANDIR): Do all the `dirent' wrangling
	only if `scandir' is needed.  Also, include <sys/types.h> in all
	cases. 

1998-04-13  Seth Alves  <alves@twitch.cp.domain.net>

	* gnomesupport-h.c (HAVE_DIRENT_H): FreeBSD needs <sys/types.h>
	before <dirent.h>.
	
1998-04-12  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (supportincludedir): Is now $(pkglibdir)/include.
	`gnomesupport.h' is a generated file dependent on the configure
	process.  So, this seems a good place.  The rest of the headers
	are also here just because I'm too lazy to maintain two separate
	include directories to search in for `libgnomesupport' stuff ;-)
	(supportinclude_DATA): New var.  Has `gnomesupport.h'.
	(BUILT_SOURCES): Generate `gnomesupport.h'.

	* gnomesupport-h.c: New file.  Used to generate `gnomesupport.h',
	which contains prototypes for many of the functions in
	`libgnomesupport'.  This method is used to ensure that prototypes
	appear only for those functions that are provided by
	`libgnomesupport'. 

	* scandir.c (alphasort): New utility function.

1998-04-08  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* scandir.c: Import from GNU libc.
	Remove assumptions that this file is compiled inside GLIBC.
	Here are the ChangeLog entries when I imported it originally into
	`gwp':

	1998-02-08  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>
        	* scandir.c (scandir): Revert change of `1998-02-07'.  
		Don't use d_reclen, but fix the expression used to
		figure out the length.

	1998-02-07  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>
	        * scandir.c (scandir): Use `d_reclen' field to get length
		of record.

	1998-02-06  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>
	        * scandir.c: New file.  Replacement function copied from
		glibc, edited to not step on implementation namespace.

1998-03-28  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* vasprintf.c (int_vasprintf): Imported from GNU libit-0.4.
	Applied a change that appears in `libiberty'.

Fri Mar 13 21:30:34 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* argp.texi: Imported from glibc.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added argp.texi.

1998-03-12  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Don't install argp-fmtstream.h and
	argp-namefrob.h.  They are used only to compile `argp' and not for
	general usage.

1998-03-11  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* getopt.h: Don't mention getopt() for C++.  (Local fix).

	* vsnprintf.c: Actually fill it in.  It is from
	<URL:http://theos.com/~deraadt/snprintf.c>, with one small fix to
	actually make it compile. 

1998-03-09  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* easy-vsnprintf.c: New file.  Provides (v)snprintf as simple
	wrappers to `__vsnprintf'.  
	* vsnprintf.c: New file.  Empty for now.

Sun Mar  8 17:13:33 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rewrote.  Library now named libgnomesupport, now
	installed if Gnome support code is built.

Sat Mar  7 00:03:26 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* gnome-argp.h (__mempcpy): New define.

	* strnlen.c: New file from glibc; needed by strndup.c.

Fri Mar  6 20:10:55 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* argp-fmtstream.h (__attribute__): Define unless using gcc.
	* argp.h (__attribute__): Define unless using gcc.

	* argp-help.c, argp-parse.c, argp.h: Imported new versions from
	glibc, while preserving local changes.

Wed Mar  4 00:58:27 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (libsupport_a_SOURCES): Added gnome-argp.c.
	* gnome-argp.c: New file.

	* argp-parse.c: Include gnome-argp.h.
	* argp-help.c: Include gnome-argp.h.

	* README-gnome, gnome-argp.h: New files.

	* argp-ba.c, argp-eexst.c, argp-fmtstream.c, argp-fmtstream.h,
	argp-fs-xinl.c, argp-help.c, argp-namefrob.h, argp-parse.c,
	argp-pv.c, argp-pvh.c, argp-test.c, argp-xinl.c, argp.h,
	strndup.c: New files, imported from glibc.  Please use "cvs
	import" if you import new versions.

	* Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Added argp-fmtstream.h,
	argp-namefrob.h, argp.h, gnome-argp.h.
	(EXTRA_DIST): New macro.

1998-02-18  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* strcasecmp.c: New file, copied from `glibc'.  Used to provide
	replacement `strcasecmp' file.
